Scheduler using OR-Tools

The scheduler uses Google OR-Tools to create a schedule for pharmacists working shifts at a pharmacy. Specifically written for three pharmacists working at a pharmacy with 2 shifts per day, 7 days a week with some additional hard constraints such as: no back to back shifts, no more than 5 shifts a week and some soft constraints like: equally distributed weekend shifts, equal evening shifts, personal "day-off" requests, etc.
